# Hands-on-II

# Classification, Regression Models and Clustering Models


## Project Overview


In this project, I have built classification, regression models and Clustering models using the Real Esatate from Chicago dataset taken from Kaggle. The goal of this project is to explore and predict Real Estate Prices using different machine learning techniques.

## Models Developed


## Classification Models:


Logistic Regression


Decision Tree


Random Forest Classifier


Gradient Boosting Classifier


K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Regression Models:


Linear Regression


Random Forest Regressor


Ridge and Lasso Regression


Gradient Boosting Regressor


Ridge, Lasso Regression and Elasti Regressions

Each model was evaluated using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score for classification, and Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared for regression.
